                    <li>Movement of colored pin is detected using a camera with Python OpenCV running to send coordinates to the MSP Launchpad using UART communication</li>
                    <li>A stepper motor control program written in C is flashed onto the MSP Launchpad to control the robot’s pointer based on the coordinates the Python program dictated</li>
